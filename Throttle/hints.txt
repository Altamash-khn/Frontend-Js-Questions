1. The Date.now() function can be used to get the current time as milliseconds since 1970. Can you use this method to keep track of how much time has elapsed since the last call to the callback function?
2. setTimeout can be used to delay execution of the callback function. For example, setTimeout(callback, 1000) would call the callback after one second.
3. setTimeout returns an ID that can be passed to the clearTimeout function to stop the callback from running. This can be combined with another call to setTimeout to reset a timeout.
4. setTimeout executes code in a different context, and thus it loses the reference to this by default. How can you ensure the callback is executed with the expected this context?
5. The call or apply method can be used to call a function with a specific this context. For example, func.apply(obj, args) would call func with obj bound to this and the args array passed as arguments.
6. Since functions are just objects, methods can be added to them just like any other object. For example myFunc.foo = function() {} would add a foo method to myFunc.
