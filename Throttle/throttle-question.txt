Write a throttle function that takes in a required callback function and a required delay in milliseconds.

1. Calling throttle(callback, delay) should return a new "throttled" version of the callback function, which takes in the same parameters as the callback, and which, when executed, should call the callback function a maximum of one time per delay interval.
2. The first time the throttled function is called, the underlying callback should run immediately. If the throttled function is called again before the delay has passed, the next call to the underlying callback should be scheduled for delay milliseconds after the last call to the callback. If the throttled function is called multiple times in a delay interval, the arguments from the last call should be used.
3. For example, repeatedly and continuously calling a throttled function which had a delay of 3000ms would call the underlying callback function exactly once every 3 seconds.
4. The throttle function should also add a cancel method to the throttled function (remember, functions are just objects). When this method is called, any scheduled callback should be cancelled.

Note that the underlying callback functions should have the this context of the throttled-function callers. For example, in the following code snippet, the underlying callback should be called with the this context of the object:


Sample Usage #1
const throttled = throttle(console.log, 3000);
document.addEventListener('keypress', () => throttled(currentTime));

// currentTime = 0ms - user starts typing.
// Callback function fires immediately: logs the currentTime at the last keypress, which was 0ms.
// currentTime = 1000ms - user stops typing.
// currentTime = 2000ms - throttled.cancel() is called.
// currentTime = 4000ms - user starts typing.
// Callback function fires immediately: logs the currentTime at the last keypress, which was 4000ms.
// currentTime = 5000ms - user stops typing; then throttled.cancel() is called.
// currentTime = 7000ms - user starts typing.
// Callback function fires immediately: logs the currentTime at the last keypress, which was 7000ms.
// currentTime = 8000ms - user stops typing.
// currentTime = 9000ms - throttled.cancel() is called.
