Write a throttlefunctionthattakesinarequiredcallbackfunctionandarequireddelayinmilliseconds.

Calling throttle(callback, delay) should return a new "throttled" version of the callback function, which takes in the
same parameters as the callback, and which, when executed, should call the callback function a maximum of one time
per delay interval.

The first time the throttled function is called, the underlying callback should run immediately. If the throttled 
function is called again before the delay has passed, the next call to the underlying callback should be scheduled for 
delay milliseconds after the last call to the callback. If the throttled function is called multiple times in a delay
interval, the arguments from the last call should be used.

For example, repeatedly and continuously calling a throttled function which had a delay of 3000ms would call the underlying callback function exactly once every 3 seconds.

The throttle function should also add a cancel method to the throttled function (remember, functions are just objects).
When this method is called, any scheduled callback should be cancelled.

Note that the underlying callback functions should have the this context of the throttled-function callers.
