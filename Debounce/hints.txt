1. To get started, try taking this problem in small steps. How would you write a function that returns a new function that calls callback parameter? Then how can you delay execution of that callback?
2. setTimeout can be used to delay execution of the callback function. For example, setTimeout(callback, 1000) would call the callback after one second.
3. setTimeout returns an ID that can be passed to the clearTimeout function to stop the callback from running. This can be combined with another call to setTimeout to reset a timeout.
4. setTimeout executes code in a different context, and thus it loses the reference to this by default. How can you ensure the callback is executed with the expected this context?
5. The call or apply method can be used to call a function with a specific this context. For example, func.apply(obj, args) would call func with obj bound to this and the args array passed as arguments.
