1. An infinite number of arguments can be accepted in a function by using a rest parameter such as function(...args) { ... }.
2. The arguments from every call to the curried function need to be saved between function calls. Can you accomplish this with a closure?
3. In order to save arguments from all of the calls to the curried function, try creating another callback function inside of the curried function, that way a closure can be created and an array of seen arguments can be saved across the function calls.
