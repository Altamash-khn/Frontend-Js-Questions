1. You can check if a value is a primitive if typeof value returns anything except object, and the value is not null.
2. You can check if an object is an array with the Array.isArray function.
3. Try approaching this problem as two separate problems. First, can you flatten a nested array? Next, can you flatten a nested object? Then finally, can you combine these two solutions into one?
