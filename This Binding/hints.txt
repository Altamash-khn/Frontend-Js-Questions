1. Think about how this binding works. How can a function be invoked with an object as its this context?
2. A function can be invoked with an object as its this context if that function is a value in the object.
3. A Symbol can be created with the Symbol() function and used as an object key. These are unique and will not affect standard iteration.
4. The delete keyword can be used to remove a key from an object.
5. The ...spread operator can be used to pass an array of values as individual arguments to a function.
6. These three functions are very similar to each other. Can you implement the last two by simply calling your first function?
